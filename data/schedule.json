Despite that, If I really had to elect one, I would choose Elixir. Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the BEAM. Created in 2012, it has been the backbone of CeSIUM's software stack and used to write and re-write almost all of its software products/services. In this talk, we will dive into the main reasons for it, whence the name, \"Why Elixir?\".",
