        "description": "There is a simple and short answer to the question: "What is the best programming language", which is: "It depends".
Despite that, If I really had to elect one, I would choose Elixir.
Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the BEAM, created in 2012 and its has been the backbone of CeSIUM's software stack and its been used to write and re-write almost all of its software products.
